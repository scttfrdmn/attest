## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `attest generate ssp` — generates a human-readable System Security Plan
  in markdown from the compiled crosswalk. Every statement is derived from
  deployed artifacts; nothing is hand-written. Includes CMMC scoring and
  control narratives with evidence references.
- `attest generate poam` — generates a Plan of Action & Milestones listing
  all gap/partial controls with milestone IDs, scheduled completion dates,
  and remediation guidance.
- `attest generate assess` — CMMC 2.0 Level 2 self-assessment scoring
  (enforced=5pts, partial=3pts, planned=1pt, gap=0pts, max 550). Includes
  per-family breakdown and assessment readiness determination.
- `attest generate oscal` — exports SSP and Assessment Results in NIST
  OSCAL 1.1.2 JSON format for GRC tool interoperability.
- `attest waiver create|list|expire` — compliance exception management.
  Waivers are YAML files in `.attest/waivers/`, validated against required
  fields, and returned with computed status (active/expiring/expired).
- `attest test` — runs policy unit test suites from `.attest/tests/*.yaml`
  against compiled Cedar policies via cedar-go. No AWS access required.
- `attest check --terraform plan.json` — evaluates a Terraform plan for
  compliance violations; `--output sarif` for GitHub annotation integration.
- HIPAA Security Rule framework (`frameworks/hipaa/framework.yaml`) — 23
  controls across 5 families. Activated via BAA agreement detection.
  Shared SCPs (scp-require-mfa, scp-require-kms-encryption, etc.) are
  deduplicated automatically against NIST 800-171 via the crosswalk.
- Git-backed policy store (`internal/store/git.go`) — `.attest/` initialized
  as a git repository on first use. Commit, Tag, and Diff methods for
  policy-as-code lifecycle management.
- `internal/document/ssp/renderer.go` — markdown renderer for the SSP.
- `internal/document/poam/` — new package for POA&M generation.
- `internal/document/assessment/` — new package for self-assessment scoring.
- `internal/document/oscal/exporter.go` — OSCAL SSP and Assessment Results
  exporters implemented (previously stubbed).
- Tests: renderer (2), POA&M generator (4), assessment generator (4),
  waiver manager (5) — 15 new tests, 72 total.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 framework definition — all 110 controls across all
  14 families. 6 controls retain full structural/operational/monitoring specs;
  remaining 104 are community-maintained skeletons with title, responsibility
  split, and assessment objectives.
- SCP condition parsing: framework YAML condition strings (`key != true`,
  `key not in [v1, v2]`, ARN patterns, `contains`, etc.) now compile into
  correct IAM Condition blocks (Bool, StringEquals, StringNotEquals, ArnLike,
  ArnNotLike, StringLike, StringNotLike operators).
- SCP size limit validation: policies exceeding the 5120-byte AWS limit are
  automatically split into multiple SCPs, each individually valid.
- Cedar schema generation: `Compiler.BuildSchema()` emits a `.cedarschema`
  file defining all entity types and their attributes, inferred from the
  framework's operational enforcement specs.
- Cedar temporal constraints: `generateFromSpec` respects `TemporalConstraint`
  — expiry constraints add `principal.training_expiry` checks, event constraints
  add `principal.irb_active`, schedule constraints add `context.hour` bounds.
- `attest compile` now calls real SCP and Cedar compilers, writes artifacts to
  `.attest/compiled/scps/`, `.attest/compiled/cedar/` (including schema), and
  `.attest/compiled/crosswalk.yaml`. Running against NIST 800-171 produces
  26 SCPs and 7 Cedar policies.
- `attest scan` now reads the compiled crosswalk for accurate posture. With
  `--region`, it compares compiled SCP IDs against deployed SCPs for live
  deployment status.
- Principal attribute resolver SAML source: reads `attest:*` IAM role tags
  (cui-training, cui-expiry, lab-id, admin-level) to hydrate Cedar principal
  entities. LDAP source interface defined; implementation deferred to community.
- `.goreleaser.yaml` for cross-platform binary releases (linux/darwin/windows,
  amd64/arm64) with framework definitions included in archives.
- SCP compiler tests: `TestParseCondition` (13 cases), `TestConditionInCompiledSCP`,
  `TestSCPSizeLimit`, `TestCompileNIST800171`.
- Cedar compiler tests: `TestCompile`, `TestCompileWithHandwrittenCedarPolicy`,
  `TestTemporalConstraints` (3 types), `TestBuildSchema`,
  `TestInferCedarType` (9 cases), `TestBuildSchemaWithTemporalContext`,
  `TestCompileFullFramework`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- `attest init` now reads a live AWS Organization via the Organizations API:
  builds SRE model, inventories existing SCPs, detects Artifact agreements,
  resolves data classifications from account tags, and writes `.attest/sre.yaml`.
- `attest scan` loads `.attest/sre.yaml` and active frameworks, resolves
  cross-framework controls, computes structural posture (SCP coverage), and
  saves a posture snapshot to `.attest/history/`.
- `internal/artifact/client.go` — full implementation of the Artifact API:
  `ListReports` (paginated), `GetReportMetadata`, `DownloadReport` (via
  GetTermForReport + GetReport presigned URL), `ListAgreements`
  (ListCustomerAgreements), `DetectFrameworkActivations`, `DetectReportChanges`.
- `internal/org/analyzer.go` — full implementation of the Organizations analyzer:
  `BuildOrgTree` (recursive OU walk), `BuildSRE`, `InventoryExistingSCPs`,
  `InventoryConfigRules` (management account; cross-account deferred to v0.3.0).
  Account tags `attest:data-class`, `attest:owner`, `attest:purpose` drive the
  environment model.
- `internal/artifact/client_test.go` — 16 table-driven tests with mock SDK.
- `internal/org/analyzer_test.go` — 13 table-driven tests with mock SDK.
- `internal/framework/loader_test.go` — 8 tests including live NIST 800-171 load.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI pipeline: go vet, go test, go build on push/PR.
- AWS SDK v2 dependencies: `service/artifact`, `service/organizations`,
  `service/configservice`, `config`.
- Isolation VPC `vpc-096e8f408e16a2c22` (10.99.0.0/16) tagged `attest-dev`
  in us-west-2 for future test resources.
